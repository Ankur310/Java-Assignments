1. What is normalization and why it is needed?

Ans---> Normalization is a process of decomposing the tables until and unless each  and 
        every sub-table should have a unique kind of data and should have a single idea.
        It is needed because when our table have a lot of columns then we might face 
        some issue while performing CRUD opertions.Actually what happens is It starts 
        to behave anomaly.
        It is used to avoid redandancy and also perform CRUD operation optimally.
